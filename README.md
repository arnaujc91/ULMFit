# ULMFit

We explain how to perform sentiment anaysis for tweets directed to Airplane Companies. The library used is [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) and the tutorial is based on the [lesson 8](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=8) from fastai and also notebooks 10 and 12 from [fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).

We can compare our results with other methods [comprehensive-twitter-airline-sentiment-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/parthsharma5795/comprehensive-twitter-airline-sentiment-analysis). Clearly ULMFit provides the best performance over any other methods which include DecisionTreeClassifieris and RandomForestClassifiers.
